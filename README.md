## About

AI-generated art has made great strides in recent years and today, astonishing results can be achieved. However, sometimes these results still look a bit...strange. Perfect for a collection of creepy birds for Halloween! All artwork in this collection is fully AI-generated with [VQGAN+CLIP](https://github.com/justinjohn0306/VQGAN-CLIP), no pixel has been altered. Species descriptions were created entirely using the [DeepAI text generator API](https://deepai.org/machine-learning-model/text-generator). Welcome to the "Scary Aviary", but beware, some of our residents are really spooky.

## Examples

### Mystic Macaw

The Mystic Macaw is an unassuming little bird, and unlike many other similar species, it does not have a distinctive, highly developed body or a distinctive plumage. While this can be seen on its back, its feathers are not sharp at all and it does not usually use its large forelimbs for covering. This may be due to the smaller size of its body. This bird is commonly referred to as "Amber Cat" in the wild. It can be seen in most of Australia, in most parts of Tasmania, New South Wales and Western Australia. It also lives in areas that are not suitable for its natural habitat, as a consequence of its large size.

### Eerie Eagle

The Eerie Eagle is a very common and very well-groomed animal that is considered very beautiful to look at or to keep in your garden. Its unique shape allows it to stand upright on its head, and the tail. The Eerie eagle is similar in size and shape to the other eagle species and has bright, and slightly yellow beak lines and bright feathers. The Eerie eagle is extremely agile and will fly more quickly than other animals. Due to their feather coloration, they are found especially in dense, densely-packed or sparsely-grown areas, especially on water or sand.

### Pumpkin Pelican

The Pumpkin Pelican has an extremely thick, very large, dark brown belly and has some dark markings at the tip of the abdomen. The pumpkin has four distinct, orange-brown glands on one leg. These glands are very small but very large for the adult. The pumpkins can also look like human ears. They have short, spiky, straight, and almost black, very large eyes. The pumpkins have a distinctive dark gray fur that is very long and is extremely large. They have no sharp or pointed teeth.

### Apocalyptic Antbird

The Apocalyptic Antbird uses naturalist techniques to destroy the natural structures and resources surrounding its territory. In the wild these creatures consume many wildlife, including plants and primates. Although their numbers have improved over nearly 20 years of study, the Apocalyptic Antbird has only recently begun to gain widespread public attention, and there are serious concerns of the potential harm it causes and how it can benefit people and the environment.

### Supernatural Sunbird

The Supernatural Sunbird is a highly intelligent species that evolved over a thousand years ago in Africa where their ancestors and close relatives were not far out of reach. Description of the Supernatural Sunbird is a mosaic of plumage, a pair of scaly wings, and a single large wing cap. Like all birds this creature has to be seen to be believed. Life cycle, size, and diet of this species vary greatly depending on how it was captured or studied.
