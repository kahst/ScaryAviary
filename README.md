## About

AI-generated art has made great strides in recent years and today, astonishing results can be achieved. However, sometimes these results still look a bit...strange. Perfect for a collection of creepy birds for Halloween! All artwork in this collection is fully AI-generated with [VQGAN+CLIP](https://github.com/justinjohn0306/VQGAN-CLIP), no pixel has been altered. Species descriptions were created entirely using the [DeepAI text generator API](https://deepai.org/machine-learning-model/text-generator). Welcome to the "Scary Aviary", but beware, some of our residents are really spooky.
